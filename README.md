# Pantograph-Catenary System for BRTS in Ahmedabad

This capstone project presents a study of the pantograph-catenary system for an electric bus in Ahmedabad. Through the help of the pantograph mechanism, the bus draws power from the overhead wires.

## Overview

This project reviews existing literature on different mechanisms that use OHL to draw power, such as single arm, double arm pantograph, and single arm double pantograph. It provides a detailed comparison between them to justify the best suitable option: the single arm pantograph covered with insulators.

## Objectives

- Review the lumped mass model of a pantograph and the effect of contact force between overhead lines and the pantograph to understand the dynamics of the catenary system and the kinematics of the pantograph mechanism.
- Analyze z-axis acceleration and speed data of the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) in Ahmedabad to determine the contact force between the pantograph-catenary system (PCS) in real-life scenarios.
- Model a catenary system to identify the catenary displacement and nominal stiffness when the bus is in motion.
- Conduct a kinematic analysis of the TATA electric bus to find the yaw angle of the steering wheel.
- Perform a kinematic analysis of the pantograph mechanism according to the real-life dimensions of a TATA electric bus and structural parameters of the catenary system.

## Implementation

- A working model of the pantograph-catenary bus system was created by scaling all dimensions down by 1/18 times.
- The model uses a remote-control system for the movement of the bus and servo communication with RFID tags for the upward and downward movement of the pantograph.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

A cost-benefit analysis has been carried out to understand the feasibility of the system when implemented in real life.
